# Optimal Sale Time of ET in Secondary Market
We model the market of execution tickets (ETs) as that of auctions of block building right where the ticket holder endogeously time the sale initiation. The framework aims to explore a conjectured equivalence between ETs and the spot / just-in-time auctions as mediated by MEV-Boost. ET markets are defined before providing an auction model. For a revenue-, equivalently, MEV-maximizing, and risk neutral proposer, and the execution right matures in a finite period of time, if the proposer optimally sells the right closer to the expiry date, buyers of the ticket must exercise the prposing right immediately. The ET mechanism with deterministic maturity, therefore, becomes a spot auction that takes place at its maturity date.
